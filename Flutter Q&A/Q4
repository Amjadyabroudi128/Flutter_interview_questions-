# Q4: What is pubspec.yaml used for?

The `pubspec.yaml` file is the core configuration file in every Flutter project.  
It defines:

- 📦 **Dependencies**: packages and plugins your app uses  
- 🖼️ **Assets**: images, fonts, icons, JSON files, etc.  
- 🏷️ **App name & description**  
- 🔢 **Version & build number**  
- 🧩 **Environment**: Dart/Flutter SDK constraints
